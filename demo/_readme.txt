0. In case you do not have data_download.m in your path, just add it with
	>> ini_path

1. For a demo where you download a sequence of images, run the command:
	>> data_download

Note: when asked, choose to download all datasets,
"PTZ_and_laser_calib.zip"	~24.3MByte
"190600_vrml_chessboard.zip"	~7.4MByte

2. For a demo where you show the sequence, as many times as desired, run the command:
	>> demo123_data_tst

Note: in case you just downloaded "190600_vrml_chessboard.zip"
you can run only the 2nd demo  >> demo123_data_tst(2)
