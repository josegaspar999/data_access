This folder contains
	datasets to use
	calibration data: cam (calib_640_v2.mat), imu (imu_params.mat), imu-cam (imu_img_trans.mat)

---

Typical usage, do once:
datasets are stored elsewhere (online) and downloaded with:
>> data_download

where "data_download.m" reads information by running .\data_download_info.m

For a demo where you show, as many times as desired, the dataset
run the command / follow the next steps:

>> sentmove2_data_tst
